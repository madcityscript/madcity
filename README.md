## Feature Breakdown

### Auto Farm System

The **mad city script auto farm** represents one of the most valuable features for players focused on accumulating in-game wealth. This system operates continuously, collecting cash from various sources throughout the map.

#### Farm Modes

Manual farming in Mad City requires constant attention as players navigate between cash spawn points, wait for respawn timers, and defend collected currency from other players. The auto farm system eliminates these challenges through intelligent automation.

The system employs several operational modes. Standard mode follows optimized routes between high-value cash spawns, collecting currency as it becomes available. Priority mode focuses exclusively on the most valuable cash sources, maximizing earnings per minute. Stealth mode incorporates evasive maneuvers to avoid detection by other players and potential anti-cheat systems.

#### Collection Efficiency

Advanced **roblox mad city script** versions analyze spawn timers and calculate optimal collection routes in real-time. The system considers factors such as spawn value, respawn time, travel distance, and current player positions to maximize efficiency.

Typical farming rates vary based on server conditions and script configuration. Conservative settings generate 50,000-100,000 cash per hour while maintaining lower detection risk. Aggressive settings can yield 150,000-250,000 cash per hour but carry increased risk. Balanced settings offer 100,000-150,000 cash per hour with moderate safety.

### Auto Rob Functionality

The **mad city script auto rob** feature automates the complex process of executing heists and robberies. Mad City includes multiple robbery locations, each with unique mechanics, timing requirements, and reward structures.

#### Supported Locations

Modern scripts support automation for all major robbery locations including Bank, Jewelry Store, Casino, Cargo Ship, Nightclub, and Prison. Each location requires specific interaction sequences and timing that the script handles automatically.

The bank robbery automation handles vault door mechanics, manages the drilling minigame, collects cash from deposit boxes, and executes escape routes. Jewelry store automation breaks display cases efficiently, collects gems while avoiding laser triggers, manages the escape vehicle, and evades pursuing police officers.

#### Robbery Optimization

The **mad city script auto rob** system employs intelligent decision-making to maximize rewards. It monitors robbery availability timers, selects the most profitable active locations, coordinates with team members when applicable, and adapts strategies based on police presence.

Advanced versions include contingency protocols for dealing with unexpected situations such as police intervention, other players interfering with the robbery, game lag or connection issues, and anti-cheat detection triggers.

### Auto Arrest Features

For players preferring the law enforcement role, the **mad city script auto arrest** provides significant advantages in apprehending criminals. This feature streamlines the arrest process through automation and targeting assistance.

#### Targeting System

The arrest automation identifies nearby criminals, calculates optimal approach paths, positions the player for successful arrests, and handles the arrest interaction automatically. The system prioritizes targets based on bounty value, proximity to the player, likelihood of successful arrest, and escape route availability.

#### Pursuit Mechanics

When criminals attempt to flee, the auto arrest feature employs predictive pathfinding to maintain pursuit. It anticipates player movements, uses shortcuts and optimal routes, coordinates with other police players when possible, and adapts to vehicle usage by criminals.

### Aimbot Enhancement

The **mad city script aimbot** provides combat assistance for players engaged in confrontations. This feature enhances accuracy and targeting efficiency during shootouts between criminals and police or between rival player groups.

#### Targeting Modes

Standard aimbot features include automatic target acquisition, smoothed aim movement for natural appearance, customizable field of view settings, and target priority configuration. Players can adjust sensitivity, prediction, and visibility checks to match their preferences.

#### Safety Features

Modern aimbot implementations incorporate safety mechanisms to reduce detection risk. These include humanized aim movement that mimics natural player behavior, configurable miss percentages to avoid perfect accuracy, reaction time delays before target acquisition, and visibility checks to prevent targeting through walls.
